# Take me to the function!

## Project Goals
1. Solidify our knowledge about functions
2. Review loops and selection
3. Enjoy the party! :blush::tada:

## Important Notes
* You should work through this README document and try it on your own. If you get stuck, come to my workshop hours or ask a follow-up question on __Piazza__ to the original discussion where I posted this problem.
* Follow best practices for programming. Your code should be neat and organized (that means using indentation to section your code!) and have plenty of comments throughout. Confused? Come to my workshop hours to discuss! :blush:
* This is __not__ an actual assignment! ***You will not clone this repository and push to it.***

## Program
__Take me to the function!__ :confetti_ball: Weâ€™re going to make a program that lets the user bring their friends to a party. The program displays a menu to the user. The user can (1) invite their friends, (2) dance, or (3) leave the party.

## Requirements
First, the user should be welcomed to the party. :wave:

Then, we display the menu of choices to the user. The user can revisit an option as many times as they want until they choose to leave the party. The menu is as follows:

```
(1) Invite some friends!
(2) Dance
(3) Leave the party (exit program)
```

***IMPORTANT HINT:*** __The menu itself should be a function AND options (1) and (2) should be separate functions as well. This means 3 functions total plus the main function.__

### Option 1: Invite some friends!

This option asks the user to provide the initials of as many friends as they want to invite. The program should keep track of how many people have been invited to the party.

### Option 2: Dance

This option should display a dancing stick figure for each person is at the party. So, if 3 friends were invited, 3 stick figures should be displayed. ***IMPORTANT HINT:*** __This means that the function for dancing should be given a parameter for the number of friends at the party.__
```
 O
~|~
 |
/ \
```
If there are no friends invited so far, then a sad face should be displayed. `:(`

### Option 3: Leave the party

This option should exit the program.

## Example Program Execution
***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** __These outputs are only a few examples of the code execution. Try running the executable in this repository, `take-me-function`, and putting in your own inputs to see what happens!__
